I'm Seksa Tianwei from China, This determines that my first language is Chinese.
I'm a junior high school student (probably in high school).

Interests are writing Java and occasionally writing C++.

Personal programming level is average, so come to this site to learn.

Can give me any advice, even criticism, as long as the language is not particularly violent...
